# Federated Learning for Data Privacy in Healthcare: A Validation Study on Predicting Mortality Rates from Electronic Medical Records.

# Objective

The objective of this research project is to explore the potential of federated learning as a solution for preserving data privacy in healthcare while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The study aims to validate the federated learning model on the MIMIC-III Clinical Database to predict patients' mortality rates and compare the model's performance with centralized models. Additionally, the project intends to examine the federated learning model's robustness and generalization capability across different data samples.

# Methodology

The research project will construct a communication framework for client-server interaction and implement federated learning on it. The project will use the MIMIC-III Clinical Database to train and validate the federated learning model's performance in predicting patients' mortality rates. The project will compare the model's performance with centralized models and evaluate its generalization capability on different data samples.

# Expected Results

The expected results of the research project are to demonstrate the potential of federated learning in preserving data privacy in healthcare while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The project aims to achieve a high level of prediction accuracy while ensuring the protection of patients' data privacy. The project also intends to provide insights into the factors that contribute to lower mortality rates and examine the model's generalization capability across different data samples.

# Conclusion

The research project aims to contribute to the growing body of literature on federated learning and its potential applications in healthcare. The project's results could inform the development of more secure and privacy-preserving machine learning models in healthcare, ultimately improving patient outcomes while ensuring their data privacy.
